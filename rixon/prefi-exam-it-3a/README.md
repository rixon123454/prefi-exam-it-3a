### Student Management API

The Student Management API is a tool for managing student data across a variety of systems. It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and modification of student records. The API could handle data such as student information and academic records.

> **Note:** This may not follow real world database structure (i.e relational) just to simplify things.
